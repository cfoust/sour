Model description       : 

	Bauul is a big orange guy that likes flowers and frilly things.
        He usually spends his time writing poetry or terrorizing the 
        local villagers.

Other info              : 
	Bauul's skin frame was created entirely in Q2modeler. I love that
	program. I don't know what i did before it. I tried to optimize
	the skin as much as possible, but i think i did so at the expense
	of all you skinners out there. You will see the skin is all cut
	up like the regular Q2 male model. I also hope someone does some
	better ctf skins, mine are quite bad.
